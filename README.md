## Overview

This repository covers the following topics:

1. **Creating Tensors**  
   Learn how to create different types of tensors including scalars, vectors, matrices, and random tensors.

2. **Getting Information from Tensors**  
   Extract tensor attributes such as shape, datatype, and device to gather useful information for tensor manipulation.

3. **Tensor Operations**  
   Perform basic tensor operations such as addition, multiplication, and subtraction, along with matrix multiplication.

4. **Reshaping and Indexing**  
   Master tensor reshaping techniques like squeezing and unsqueezing, stacking, and permuting tensors for manipulation.

5. **Aggregation Functions**  
   Find the minimum, maximum, mean, sum, and other aggregation functions in tensors.

6. **Finding the Positional Min and Max**  
   Discover how to locate the indices of the minimum and maximum values within a tensor.

7. **Dealing with Tensor Datatypes**  
   Learn to handle and change tensor datatypes, including float, int, and boolean tensors.

8. **Tensor Interactions with NumPy**  
   Convert data between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors.

9. **GPU Acceleration**  
   Learn how to utilize NVIDIA GPUs for faster computation using CUDA and check device availability.

10. **Reproducibility**  
   Use `torch.manual_seed()` to ensure reproducibility of results in neural networks.
