# [PyTorch Fundamentals](Your-Repository-Link-Here)

This repository demonstrates essential PyTorch features such as:

- Creating and manipulating tensors
- Tensor operations (addition, multiplication, etc.)
- Matrix multiplication
- Tensor reshaping and indexing
- Tensor aggregation functions (min, max, mean, etc.)
- Interaction with NumPy
- GPU acceleration with CUDA
- Reproducibility with manual seed

## Overview

This repository covers the following topics:

1. **Creating Tensors**  
   Learn how to create different types of tensors including scalars, vectors, matrices, and random tensors.

2. **Tensor Operations**  
   Perform basic tensor operations such as addition, multiplication, and subtraction, along with matrix multiplication.

3. **Reshaping and Indexing**  
   Master tensor reshaping techniques like squeezing and unsqueezing, stacking, and permuting tensors for manipulation.

4. **Aggregation Functions**  
   Find the minimum, maximum, mean, sum, and other aggregation functions in tensors, and explore positional min/max.

5. **Tensor Interactions with NumPy**  
   Convert data between NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors.

6. **GPU Acceleration**  
   Learn how to utilize NVIDIA GPUs for faster computation using CUDA and check device availability.

7. **Reproducibility**  
   Use `torch.manual_seed()` to ensure reproducibility of results in neural networks.
